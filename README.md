🧠 Model Overview

Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple models for better accuracy and generalization.
In this project, the following algorithms are used:

Random Forest

AdaBoost

Gradient Boosting

For more details, see the Scikit-learn Documentation
.

📊 Dataset

The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

Classes: Malignant, Benign

Features: 30 real-valued features (mean, standard error, and worst of cell nuclei characteristics)

Dataset Link

📈 Results

Achieved >90% accuracy on the test dataset.

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve.
