## About the Project
This project aims to predict breast cancer using ensemble learning methods. It leverages the power of combining multiple machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. The ensemble methods implemented include Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn 
flask

## Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use the project, run the following command:

python predict.py 

## Model Overview
Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to produce a more accurate and robust prediction. In this project, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting are used for breast cancer prediction. For more details on ensemble methods, refer to scikit-learn documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. It consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Training
To train the models, use the following command:

python train.py 

## Evaluation
To evaluate the models, use the following command:

python evaluate.py 

## Results
The models achieved an accuracy of >90% on the test set. For detailed results and visualizations, refer to the Results section.
